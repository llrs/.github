Thanks for looking at the contributing guide.

If you have a comment a suggestion or would like to do ask a question about this software, please open an issue.

Improvements to make the code easier to read and faster are generally welcome.

If you want to make a pull request try to mimic the style of the code:
 - If the code is written in R follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) (with a mix of Bioconductor style) but that can be addressed
 - If the code is written in python I follow the [pep 8 style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
